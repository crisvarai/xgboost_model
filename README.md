# xgboost_model

XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks. However, when it comes to small-to-medium structured/tabular data, decision tree based algorithms are considered best-in-class right now.

One of the key features of XGBoost is its efficient handling of missing values, which allows it to handle real-world data with missing values without requiring significant pre-processing. Additionally, XGBoost has built-in support for parallel processing, making it possible to train models on large datasets in a reasonable amount of time.

It is also highly customizable and allows for fine-tuning of various model parameters to optimize performance.
